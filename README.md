# Enough LaTex To get your report done

LaTex is perfect for creating proffesional reports with proffessional and good layouts. However, it can be intimadating either in terms of usage or learning. Here I am going to use a practical approach.

You are not learning LaTex in the void but rather in a very specific context which is writting reports. In my case, I am using it for writting end of year project report.

I am trying to make it a quick guide made by a begineer for fellow begineers.

***NOTE:*** If you have any suggestions, notes, or spotted mistakes, I would truly appreciate it if you note them out.

## What is Latex

Checking Latex Official website, we find this definition:

"*LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents.*"

As it is clear from this definition, LaTeX is a *document preparation system* used in **STEM** fields whether in reports, research papers, or technical books.

It is widely spread due to many factors, mainly:

- It is open source.
- It has a huge community.
- It proved its worth and quality.

## Why Latex for reports

Reports usually contain multiple chapters, equations, figures, references and bibliography. Latex handles these for you automatically, making writing reports smoother.

With LaTeX, you can divide reports into multiple files making it easier to manage long reports without making it more complex.

LaTeX automatically handles figures, tables, equations, and citations. So, you don’t need to worry about numbering or updating references manually.

Also it handles equations better than any other available option.

So, what you get with using LaTeX is a mature tooling that automates much of the work needed while producing high quality documents.

This is more than enough to consider LaTeX for any reports writing.
